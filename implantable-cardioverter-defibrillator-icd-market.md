<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Chamber ICD</li><li>Dual Chamber ICD</li><li>Biventricular ICD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) market includes three primary types: Single Chamber ICD, Dual Chamber ICD, and Biventricular ICD. Single Chamber ICDs monitor and treat ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation using one lead, making them suitable for patients with specific arrhythmias. Dual Chamber ICDs use two leads to coordinate pacing in both the atrium and ventricle, enhancing cardiac function. Biventricular ICDs support advanced heart failure by pacing both ventricles, improving synchronization and overall heart efficiency. Each type addresses different patient needs based on individual cardiac conditions.</p></p>
