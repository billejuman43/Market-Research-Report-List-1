<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chemical Fume Hood Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ductless Fume Hoods</li><li>Ducted Fume Hoods</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The chemical fume hood market is segmented into ductless and ducted fume hoods. Ductless fume hoods filter and recirculate air within the laboratory, utilizing high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) or activated carbon filters, making them ideal for environments without external venting options. Ducted fume hoods, on the other hand, exhaust hazardous fumes externally through ductwork, providing efficient removal of harmful substances, and are commonly used in laboratories requiring stringent ventilation standards. Both types enhance safety and compliance in chemical handling.</p></p>
