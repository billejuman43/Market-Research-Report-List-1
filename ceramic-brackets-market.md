<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ceramic Brackets Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-Ligating</li><li>Conventional</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ceramic brackets market is primarily categorized into two types: self-ligating and conventional brackets. Self-ligating brackets utilize a built-in mechanism to hold the archwire in place, reducing friction and facilitating quicker tooth movement. They also eliminate the need for elastic ligatures, offering aesthetic benefits. In contrast, conventional ceramic brackets require elastic ties to secure the archwire, which can create more friction but often come at a lower cost. Both types cater to patient preferences for aesthetics and comfort in orthodontic treatment.</p></p>
