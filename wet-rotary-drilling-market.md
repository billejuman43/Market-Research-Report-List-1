<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wet Rotary Drilling Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Side Water Supply</li><li>Central Water Supply</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wet rotary drilling utilizes water to facilitate drilling operations, and it primarily encompasses two market types: side water supply and central water supply. In side water supply systems, water is introduced through ports on the drill string, which helps cool the bit and remove cuttings. Conversely, central water supply systems deliver water from a central source directly into the borehole, often allowing for more effective cooling and cleaning. Both methods enhance drilling efficiency and reduce wear on equipment.</p></p>
